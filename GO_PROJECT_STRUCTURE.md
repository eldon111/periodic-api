# Go Project Structure and Test Organization

## Directory Structure in Go Applications

Go has some conventional directory structures that are widely adopted in the community. The standard Go project layout typically follows these conventions:

```
project-root/
├── cmd/                    # Main applications for this project
│   └── app/                # The main application directory
│       └── main.go         # The main application entry point
├── internal/               # Private application and library code
│   ├── pkg1/               # Private packages
│   │   ├── pkg1.go
│   │   └── pkg1_test.go    # Tests for pkg1
│   └── pkg2/
│       ├── pkg2.go
│       └── pkg2_test.go    # Tests for pkg2
├── pkg/                    # Library code that's ok to use by external applications
│   ├── pkg3/
│   │   ├── pkg3.go
│   │   └── pkg3_test.go    # Tests for pkg3
│   └── pkg4/
│       ├── pkg4.go
│       └── pkg4_test.go    # Tests for pkg4
├── api/                    # OpenAPI/Swagger specs, JSON schema files, protocol definition files
├── web/                    # Web application specific components
├── configs/                # Configuration file templates or default configs
├── scripts/                # Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations
└── test/                   # Additional external test apps and test data
```

## Test File Organization in Go

In Go, the standard practice is to place test files in the same package as the code they test. The Go tooling and ecosystem are built around this convention.

### Standard Go Test Organization

1. **Test files are placed in the same directory as the code they test**
   - For a file named `user.go`, the test file would be `user_test.go`
   - Both files would be in the same directory and package

2. **Test file naming convention**
   - Test files are named with the `_test.go` suffix
   - Example: `user_test.go` tests the code in `user.go`

3. **Test function naming convention**
   - Test functions start with `Test` followed by the name of the function being tested
   - Example: `TestCreateUser` tests the `CreateUser` function

### Benefits of Go's Test Organization

1. **Proximity**: Tests are close to the code they test, making it easier to understand and maintain both
2. **Package access**: Tests have access to unexported (private) functions and variables in the package
3. **Simplicity**: The convention is simple and consistent across Go projects
4. **Tooling support**: Go's testing tools expect this structure

### Alternative Approaches

While the standard approach is to place tests in the same directory, some projects use these alternatives:

1. **Separate test package**
   - Tests can be placed in a package with the same name plus `_test`
   - Example: code in package `user`, tests in package `user_test`
   - This approach tests the public API only, as private functions are not accessible

2. **Separate test directory**
   - Some projects place integration or end-to-end tests in a separate `/test` directory
   - Unit tests still follow the standard convention of being in the same directory as the code they test

## Current Project Structure

The current project follows Go's standard practice:

- Implementation files: `user_db_store.go`, `scheduled_item_db_store.go`, `todo_item_db_store.go`
- Test files: `user_db_store_test.go`, `scheduled_item_db_store_test.go`, `todo_item_db_store_test.go`

All test files are placed in the same directory as the code they test, which is the recommended approach in Go.

## Conclusion

The current project structure follows Go's recommended practices for test organization. Test files are correctly placed in the same directory as the code they test, with the standard `_test.go` suffix.

This approach is considered a best practice in the Go community and is supported by Go's tooling. It provides a good balance of proximity, accessibility, and organization.
